      <p><span><b>2nd price:</b> M2M Innovation Awards</span></p>
      <p class="letter-spacing">I received the 2nd place in a nationwide competition called 'M2M Innovation Awards' which is aimed to all the university students in Sweden and held every year. I called my idea 'Save the Heart' and the idea behind it was that when a defibrillator/heart starter is moved and in use an alarm is automatically sent to the nearest emergency center, where medical personnel can localize the exact position of the defibrillator/heart starter and be able to arrive faster to the scene. For the person who is using the device this means that he/she doesn't need to call the emergency center and can concentrate their attention on helping the affected person. Through built in speaker and microphone a line of communication can be established where important information about the affected person can be given and received, information which can be the difference between life and death.</p>
